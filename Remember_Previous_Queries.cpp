// problem number 5

// Problem Statement

// You have a doubly linked list which is empty initially. Then you will be given Q queries. In each query you will be given two values X and V.

// If X is 0 that means you will insert the value V to the head of the linked list.
// If X is 1 then you will insert the value V to the tail of the linked list.
// If X is 2 then you will delete the value Vth index of the linked list. Assume that index starts from 0. If the index is invalid, then you shouldn't perform the deletion.
// After each query you need to print the linked list from both left to right and right to left.
// Note: You must use STL List, otherwise you will not get marks.

// Input Format

// First line will contain Q.
// Next Q lines will contain X and V.
// Constraints

// 1 <= Q <= 1000;
// 0 <= X <= 2;
// 0 <= V <= 10^9
// Output Format

// For each query print the linked list from left to right and right to left.
// Print "L -> " before printing the linked list from left to right.
// Print "R -> " before printing the linked list from right to left.
